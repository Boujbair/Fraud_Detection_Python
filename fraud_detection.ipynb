    "\n",
    "**Course Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical organization loses an estimated 5% of its yearly revenue to fraud. In this course, learn to fight fraud by using data. Apply supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior based upon past fraud, and use unsupervised learning methods to discover new types of fraud activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to the norm.  As such, learn to properly classify imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course provides technical and theoretical insights and demonstrates how to implement fraud detection models. Finally, get tips and advice from real-life experience to help prevent common mistakes in fraud analytics."

    "In this exercise, you're going to re-balance our data using the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique** (SMOTE). Unlike ROS, SMOTE does not create exact copies of observations, but **creates new, synthetic, samples** that are quite similar to the existing observations in the minority class. SMOTE is therefore slightly more sophisticated than just copying observations, so let's apply SMOTE to our credit card data. The dataset `df` is available and the packages you need for SMOTE are imported. In the following exercise, you'll visualize the result and compare it to the original data, such that you can see the effect of applying SMOTE very clearly.\n",

    "In the last exercise, you saw that using SMOTE suddenly gives us more observations of the minority class. Let's compare those results to our original data, to get a good feeling for what has actually happened. Let's have a look at the value counts again of our old and new data, and let's plot the two scatter plots of the data side by side. You'll use the function compare_plot() for that that, which takes the following arguments: `X`, `y`, `X_resampled`, `y_resampled`, `method=''`. The function plots your original data in a scatter plot, along with the resampled side by side.\n",

Since, a random method describes a horizontal curve through the unit interval, it has an AUC of 0.5. Minimally, classifiers should perform better than this, and the extent to which they score higher than one another (meaning the area under the ROC curve is larger), they have better expected performance.**"

It retrieves the details of the topics for each line of text. With that function, you can append the results back to your original data.
